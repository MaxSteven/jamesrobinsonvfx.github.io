I"<p>Most people are probably familiar with the following workflow for sealing up
gaps and holes in an SDF using 2 <strong>VDB Reshape SDF</strong> nodes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set the first one to <strong>Dilate</strong></li>
  <li>Set the second one to <strong>Erode</strong></li>
  <li>Channel reference the <strong>Offset</strong> parameter from the dilating node to the
<strong>Offset</strong> parameter of the eroding node.</li>
  <li>Adjust the offset until you’re happy</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to keep a filled interior, don’t forget to set the <strong>Trim</strong>
parameter to <strong><em>None</em></strong>! (Houdini 18.5+)</p>

<p>Not sure when this was added (or maybe it has been here the whole time!), but
there is another method that does the exact same thing in one go: <strong>Close</strong>.</p>
