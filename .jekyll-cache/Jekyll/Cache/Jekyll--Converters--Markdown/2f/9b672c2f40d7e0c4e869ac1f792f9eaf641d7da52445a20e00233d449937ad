<p>A few weeks ago, my co-worker and friend <a href="https://www.artstation.com/omartaher">Omar
Taher</a> came to me with an issue: he had a
hair groom made of triangulated cards, and wanted to extract centerline curves
from them to use as guides.</p>

<p>Sounds easy enough at first, but given some wonky polygon winding and shapes, it
took a little extra work to make sure it was stable on every card.</p>

<p>Checkout the hipfile to see the setup, and crack open the hda for a deeper look.</p>
