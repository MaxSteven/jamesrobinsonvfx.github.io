<h3 id="dilate-and-erode-old">Dilate and Erode (Old)</h3>
<p>Most people are probably familiar with the following workflow for sealing up
gaps and holes in an SDF using 2 <strong>VDB Reshape SDF</strong> nodes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set the first one to <strong>Dilate</strong></li>
  <li>Set the second one to <strong>Erode</strong></li>
  <li>Channel reference the <strong>Offset</strong> parameter from the dilating node to the
<strong>Offset</strong> parameter of the eroding node.</li>
  <li>Adjust the offset until youâ€™re happy</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to keep a filled interior, donâ€™t forget to set the <strong>Trim</strong>
parameter to <strong>None</strong> (Houdini 18.5+)!</p>

<h3 id="close-new">Close (New)</h3>
<p>Not sure when this was added (or maybe it has been here the whole time!), but
there is another method that does the exact same thing in one go: <strong>Close</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A side-by-side comparison of the two looks like you get the same result!</p>
