<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, my friend and co-worker <a href="https://www.artstation.com/omartaher">Omar
Taher</a> came to me with an issue: he had a
hair groom made of triangulated cards, and wanted to extract centerline curves
from them to use as guides.</p>

<h2 id="get-it">Get it</h2>
<p>Download the latest release <a href="https://github.com/jamesrobinsonvfx/cards_to_curves/releases/latest/download/cards_to_curves.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p>Full repo <a href="https://github.com/jamesrobinsonvfx/cards_to_curves">here</a>.</p>

<p>Inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">houdini18.5/hda</code> folder you can grab the HDA and put it someplace
where Houdini will find it. Otherwise, you can install it as a <a href="https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/plugins.html">Houdini
Package</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the release zip</li>
  <li>Navigate to your Houdini user preferences folder (ie. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/houdini18.5</code>)</li>
  <li>Create a folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packages</code> if it doesn’t exist yet</li>
  <li>Copy the downloaded zip into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packages</code></li>
  <li>Extract the contents, and delete the zip archive if you want</li>
  <li>Drag the file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cards_to_curves.json</code> up one level into to that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">packages</code> folder</li>
</ol>

<p>There is also a demo file located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">houdini18.5/hip</code> with some usage examples.</p>

<p>See the the help card on the node for more detailed info.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<p>Sounds easy enough at first, but given some wonky polygon winding and shapes, it
took a little extra work to make sure it was stable on every card.</p>

<h3 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h3>

<p>At first, not knowing much about how groom artists create hair cards, I took a
VEX approach that matched up pairs of points based on their neighbors, and added
a point at their center.
Unfortunately, that only worked when the cards were made with one row of
alternating triangles, and after downloading a few more free hair card grooms, I
realized that this method fails spectacularly if the artist created it
differently.</p>

<h3 id="final">Final</h3>

<p>Luckily, one thing all good hair card grooms have in common: they have nice UVs!
Should have thought of that sooner! This makes finding the centerline a breeze:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Evaluate the connectivity.</li>
  <li>Split geo by UV seams, and promote <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv</code> attribute to points (if it isn’t
there already).</li>
  <li><strong>Swap</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">P</code> for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UV</code>, so the points now look like a UV layout, but in world
space near the origin in the viewport.</li>
  <li>Iterate over each connected piece (card), and create a line down the center
of the bounding box, from the top to the bottom.</li>
  <li>Add some more points to these lines with a <strong>Resample</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Ray</strong> the lines to the flattened hair card geo.</li>
  <li>Use an <strong>Attribute Interpolate</strong> to put them back into world space.</li>
</ol>

<p>Checkout the hipfile to see the setup, and crack open the hda for a deeper look.</p>

<h2 id="tool-features">Tool Features</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, this node will create guide curves from hair cards.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/projects/hair-cards-to-guide-curves/images/cycle-grooms.gif" alt="Cycle Grooms" /></p>

<p>By default, the tool is pretty straight forward. Plug in the static cards into
the first input, get curves out! As long as you have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">uv</code> attribute (that
works) you should get something useable.</p>

<h3 id="single-card--guide-geometry">Single Card &amp; Guide Geometry</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/projects/hair-cards-to-guide-curves/images/single-card.gif" alt="Single Card" /></p>

<p>Enable the <strong>Single Card</strong> parameter to scrub through the cards one at a time
for a quick debugging visualization.</p>

<h3 id="stick-to-animation">Stick to Animation</h3>
<p>If a second input is connected, the guides will interpolate attributes
(including position) from that geometry stream.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure the topology matches the original cards from the first input!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>If you’re getting bad guides that zig zag, or look like they’re spanning across
multiple guides, make sure the input cards are clean. There is a <strong>Poly Doctor</strong>
embedded in the node that should help clean up non-manifold geometry, but
sometimes it can’t do all the work! Make sure that any problem cards are
actually being treated as separate connected islands per-card. Otherwise either
fix them, or delete them!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Enjoy! If you have any problems, please feel welcome to add an issue to the
github repo, or reach out to me directly.</p>
