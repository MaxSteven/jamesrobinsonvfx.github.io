# Hair Cards to Guide Curves

A few weeks ago, my co-worker and friend [Omar
Taher](https://www.artstation.com/omartaher) came to me with an issue: he had a
hair groom made of triangulated cards, and wanted to extract centerline curves
from them to use as guides.

Sounds easy enough at first, but given some wonky polygon winding and shapes, it
took a little extra work to make sure it was stable on every card.

Checkout the hipfile to see the setup, and crack open the hda for a deeper look.
