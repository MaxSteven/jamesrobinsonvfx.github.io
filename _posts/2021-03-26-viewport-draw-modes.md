I recently discovered that you can actually set the viewport drawing modes to be
unique per Shading Mode. ie. when templating geo, you can shade with "Wireframe
Ghost" instead of the default template wireframe.

This combined with a thinner wire width makes for a pretty pleasing experience!
The ghost mode when templated also sort of helps show a bit more depth.
