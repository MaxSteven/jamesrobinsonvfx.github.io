## Overview

In the past few releases, SideFX has been going pretty hard with the multi-output workflow style nodes, particularly with Vellum and RBD SOPs.

The most common way to view the outputs of these nodes is to just drop a null
down and display it.

[![Drop a Null]({{ images }}/drop-a-null.png)]({{ images }}/drop-a-null.png)

This can be useful for other things, but sometimes you just want a quicker way,
with less clutter!

## Output for View

[![Output for View]({{ images }}/rmb-menu.png)]({{ images }}/rmb-menu.png)

> RMB > Flags > Output for View

Right-click menu to the rescue! You can actually set the output you want to view
by changing a flag from the menu.

***This will not affect the actual output result of the node!*** This is
important to note, because it only affects the display, not what is actually
being passed through the outputs.

## Assigning a Hotkey

Since this option is in a menu (like a lot of other useful options!), we can
actually bind this to a hotkey.

[![Hotkey Editor]({{ images }}/hotkey-editor.png)]({{ images }}/hotkey-editor.png)


1. Open the hotkey editor
    > Edit > Hotkeys
2. Search for Set View Output
3. Assign a hotkey for outputs 1 - 4

> On Linux/Windows, I find that Ctrl + Alt + 1 (1 through 4) works nicely.

> This post was written on a macbook, so here itâ€™s just Option + Cmd + 1-4

Now, changing the displayed output is as easy as selecting the node and cycling
through your new hotkeys!

## Bonus: Python

If you're interesting in doing something scripty with this, you can use the
following snippet to change the output:

```python
# Outputs are a zero-based index
node = hou.node("/obj/geo1/vellumtetrahedral")
node.setOutputForViewFlag(1)
```
